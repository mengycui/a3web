	<div class="PPTextBoxes">
		<h3> Drone Delivery Ethiopia </h3>
		<h4> Non-profit: Ethiopia Flying Labs </h4>
		<p> As the use of unmanned aerial vehicles becomes more affordable and accessible, organizations such as the Flying Labs are making strides 
			in this sector across the world. In many areas of the world there is a struggle with the last mile problem especially in cases of essential 
			healthcare delivery. Accessibility to healthcare is a huge concern according to the World Health Organization and we worked with Ethiopia 
			Flying Labs to map out new routes to rural facilities. The new routes were created with input from local on the ground staff and allows for 
			communities in rural sectors to gain access to vaccines and medical care that they would otherwise be denied. </p>
	</div>		
	<div class="PPTextBoxes">
		<h3> High Park Accessibility Toronto, Canada </h3>
		<h4> Government: Ministry of Transportation</h4>
		<p> Accessibility and walkability are important factors when it comes to park access. The Ministry of Transportation in Toronto has been trying to improve 
			both of these aspects for the local population. High Park is one of the most well-known travel destinations in the City of Toronto and through local 
			infrastructure a report was created to highlight the accessibility of access to this park.  This report will be used as an exemplar as the Ministry of T
			ransportation examines park accessibility across the city.  </p>
	</div>	

	<div class="PPTextBoxes">
		<h3> Right Whale and Shipping Routes </h3>
		<h4> Nonprofit: Ocean conservancy</h4>
		<p> The Right Whale is at risk of extinction. In studies it shows there are fewer than 350 left in the world. This rare whale species is at risk of vehicle 
			strikes in the ocean. Ocean Conservancy is working hard to protect this species and reached out to collaborate with our organization. Through problem mapping
			 and extensive academic research we used whale tracking and known shipping routes to create a report on alternative routes that would cause minimal shipping 
			 disruption. </p>
	</div>		

	<div class="PPTextBoxes">	
		<h3> Hurricanes in the Southern Hemisphere  </h3>
		<h4> Intergovernmental Organization: World Meteorological Organization  </h4>
		<p> The World Meteorological Organization is a specialized agency within the United Nations, and they have an interest in extreme weather events. The damage and 
			disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost caused by extreme weather events continues to grow annually. We created a report examining  hurricane patterns in the 
			Southern Hemisphere and highlighted areas of concern where huge potential damage can be caused within the next 5-25 years.  </p>
	</div>	

	<div class="PPTextBoxes">
		<h3> Rising of women's sports</h3>
		<h4> For-Profit: Nike</h4>
		<p> There has been a rise in the interest towards women's sports. The pinnacle of this in the last year was the FIFA 2023 Women's World Cup hosted in Australia 
			and New Zealand.  This past world cup has generated a record breaking $570 million in revenue alongside record-breaking ticket sales and viewership. 
			Nike a sponsor for many of the National Teams that were present at the world cup wanted to capitalize on this moment. Their marketing team requested a 
			geospatial report on the fastest rising women's sports in countries across the world. They used our report to help determine which grassroots and established
			 teams they will pursue in the next cycle.

	<h2> 2022 Number of Projects: 3 </h2>

	<div class="PPTextBoxes">
		<h3> Mapping flood plains in glacial floods in Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda </h3>
		<h4> Nonprofit: Humanitarian Coalition </h4>
		<p> As global temperatures rise the glaciers on the Rwenzori Mountain range continue to melt at alarming rates. The flooding caused by the melting of the glaciers 
			impacts farming communities downstream and this causes food insecurity among many local communities. Through the use of flood mapping solutions and examination 
			of NDVI Trends we created sustainable solutions to help mitigate the impact of these floods. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="PPTextBoxes">
		<h3> Food Deserts in Toronto, Ontario </h3>
		<h4> Academic: University of Toronto </h4>
		<p> Food deserts are considered to be a lack of access to supermarkets or local markets that sell reasonable substance.  In Toronto as living costs increased over
			 the last couple of years it has become apparent that food insecurity is on the rise with record people recording an inability to access and afford food. We aided 
			 the University of Toronto in mapping out the local food markets in the inner suburbs of Toronto.  Through extensive web research and in person on the ground surveying, 
			 we determined the areas that were considered to be food deserts.  This information was captured in a 40-page report on potential solutions that are aligned with the 
			 most recent Toronto Food Strategy report published in 2018.  </p>
	</div>

	<div class="PPTextBoxes">
		<h3> Wildfires in Alberta, Canada </h3>
		<h4> Government: Alberta Ministry of Natural Resources </h4>
		<p>Climate change increases extreme natural disaster events, and this can be seen in the case of wildfires. The Ministry of Natural Resources was concerned about wildfire 
			preparedness in the province of Alberta and reached out to our organization. We created a 50-page report on the geospatial patterns of wildfire occurrence in Alberta, 
			wildfire risk areas, and historic rain patterns in the region. The Ministry of Natural Resources used our report to create a sustainability plan for the future outlook 
			of the province.</p>
